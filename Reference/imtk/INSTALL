For now, edit toplevel makefile.
Set PREFIX to the location you
want the includes, libs, bins, and docs installed. Then do
'make'
'make install'
which should build the base IMTK library, tools, and the test cases.

At some point make may be discarded in favor of jam, but not untill
I am more familiar with jambase and jamfiles.


At a later date, this will use a configure script. Building the
shared libs on many systems is much easier using GNU Autoconf, Automake,
and Libtool, however, it does not support C++ too well (as far as I can tell).
