This directory contains the alpha version (0.0.1 release) of IMTK (the
IMage analysis ToolKit) a numerical toolkit for algorithm 
prototyping and development in medical imaging.

IMTK is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying
permission.

The file INSTALL contains a copy of the installation information. You
will need a C++ compiler that supports templates, namespaces and RTTI 
(gcc > 2.8.1 should work). You might also need the GNU version of make.

See the file ChangeLog for the latest modifications.
