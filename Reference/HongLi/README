This directory contains the alpha version (0.0.1 release) of 
capd, a command line tool for detecting colorectal polyps
from Computed Tomography data.

capd is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying
permission.

The file INSTALL contains a copy of the installation information. You
will need a C++ compiler that supports templates, namespaces and RTTI 
(gcc > 2.8.1 should work). You might also need the GNU version of make.

See the file ChangeLog for the latest modifications.
