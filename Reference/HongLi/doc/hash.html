<P>

Choosing a good hashing function, <B>h(k)</B>,
is essential for hash-table based searching.
<B>h</B> should distribute the elements of our collection as
uniformly as possible to the "slots" of the hash table. 
The key criterion is that there should be a minimum number of collisions.
<P>
If the probability that a key, <B>k</B>, occurs in our
collection is <B>P(k)</B>, then if there are <B>m</B>
slots in our hash table,
a <I>uniform hashing function</I>, <B>h(k)</B>, would
ensure:<P>
<IMG SRC="fig/uniform_hash.gif">
<P>
Sometimes, this is easy to ensure.
For example, if the keys are randomly distributed in
(0,<B>r</B>],
then, 
<P>
<CENTER><B>h(k) = floor((mk)/r)</B></CENTER>
<P>
will provide uniform hashing.
<P>

<H4>Mapping keys to natural numbers</H4>

Most hashing functions will first map the keys
to some set of natural numbers, say (0,r].
There are many ways to do this,
for example if the key is a string of ASCII characters,
we can simply add the ASCII representations of the
characters mod 255 to produce a number in (0,255) -
or we could <B>xor</B> them,
or we could add them in pairs mod 2<SUP>16</SUP>-1,
or ...
<P>
Having mapped the keys to a set of natural numbers,
we then have a number of possibilities.
<OL>
<LI>Use a <B>mod</B> function:<P>
<B>h(k) = k mod m</B>.
<P>
When using this method, we
usually avoid certain values of <B>m</B>.
Powers of 2 are usually avoided,
for <B>k mod 2<SUP>b</SUP></B>
simply selects the <B>b</B> low order bits of <B>k</B>.
Unless we know that all the 2<B><SUP>b</SUP></B> possible
values of the lower order bits are equally likely,
this will not be a good choice,
because some bits of the key are not used in the hash function.
<P>
Prime numbers which are close to powers of 2 
seem to be generally good choices for <B>m</B>.
<P>
For example, if we have 4000 elements, and we have
chosen an overflow table organization, but wish to
have the probability of collisions quite low,
then we might choose <B>m</B> = 4093.
(4093 is the largest prime less than 4096 = 2<SUP>12</SUP>.)
<P>
<LI>Use the multiplication method:
<P><UL>
<LI>Multiply the key by a constant <B>A</B>,
0 &lt; <B>A</B> &lt; 1,
<LI>Extract the fractional part of the product,
<LI>Multiply this value by <B>m</B>.
</UL><P>
Thus the hash function is:
<P><CENTER><B>h(k) = floor(m * (kA - floor(kA)))</B></CENTER>
<P>
In this case, the value of <B>m</B> is not critical and
we typically choose a power of 2 so that we can get the
following efficient procedure on most digital computers:
<UL>
<LI>Choose <B>m</B> = 2<SUP><B>p</B></SUP>.
<LI>Multiply the <B>w</B> bits of <B>k</B> by
<B>floor(A * 2<SUP>w</SUP>)</B> to
obtain a 2<B>w</B> bit product.
<LI>Extract the <B>p</B> most significant bits of the
lower half of this product.
<P>
It seems that:
<P><CENTER><B>A</B> = (sqrt(5)-1)/2 = 0.6180339887</CENTER>
<P>
is a good choice (<I>see</I> Knuth,
"Sorting and Searching", v. 3 of "The Art of Computer
Programming").
</UL>
<P>
<LI> Use universal hashing:<P>
A malicious adversary can always chose the keys
so that they all hash to the same slot,
leading to an average <B>O(n)</B> retrieval time.
Universal hashing seeks to avoid this by choosing the
hashing function randomly from a collection of hash 
functions (<I>cf</I> Cormen <I>et al</I>, p 229- ).
This makes the probability that the hash function
will generate poor behaviour small and produces good
average performance.
