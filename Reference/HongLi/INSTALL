INSTALL information for capd

Copy the appropriate makeinclude from
the build directory to the toplevel
directory (rename to makeinclude) 
and edit for your particular configuration.

capd requires the following libraries
- dcmtk
- zlib

Set PREFIX to the location you want the includes, 
libs, bins, and docs installed. Then do
'make'
'make install'
which should build the src and do an install.

*At some point make may be discarded in favor of jam, but not until
we am more familiar with jambase and jamfiles.
