     FltkImageViewer


WHAT IS THIS ?

This is a set of classes that perform
image visualization using the FLTK toolkit
as GUI.


WHAT DO I NEED TO RUN IT ?

Given that GUI and visualization are not part of
the functionalities offered by the Insight Toolkit,
external libraries are required for building full
applications. The GUI is implemented using FLTK 
(the Fast Light Toolkit) that can be freely downloaded 
from http://www.fltk.org.


HOW TO BUILD IT ?


To build this library you should follow
these steps 


1) Download and install FLTK following
   the instructions in
 
       http://www.fltk.org

2) Run CMake (CMakeSetup on windows or
   ccmake on unix) on the InsightApplications
   project.

3) Set the CMake variable "USE_FLTK" to ON

4) Verify that CMake find all the FLTK
   elements:

   a- Fluid
   b- The header files
   c- The basic library     "fltk"
   d- The forms library     "fltk_forms"
   e- The images library    "fltk_images"
   f- The OpenGL library    "fltk_gl"

   Hit the "Configure" button in CMake
   and then "Generate"

5) Build InsightApplications

   The FltkImageViewer library will be 
   generated as part of the build  
   process. You will find the library
   in the Binary directory you provided
   to CMake.
