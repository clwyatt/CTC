Changes to somtoolbox / Kimmo Raivio

1.10.02

New copy of somtoolbox from 
/share/www/htdocs/projects/somtoolbox/package/codes2 
to /share/matlab_local/somtoolbox
Old has been named /share/matlab_local/somtoolbox011002.

vis_som_show_data has been modified to be ok with matlab65 and logical
variables (double conversion has been added)
This new version has also been added to 
/share/www/htdocs/projects/somtoolbox/package/codes2
I hope it is ok.

kmeans function has been changed to som_kmeans
Name has also been changed in kmeans_clusters, som_kmeanscolor2, somtoolbox
and Contents 

kmeans_clusters
cluster indices vector returned by som_kmeans has been transponed so that
it is of same shape than the initialized cluster(1) indices.
Parameters of db_index are re_ordered i.e. order of cluster prototypes 
and indices are changed.
