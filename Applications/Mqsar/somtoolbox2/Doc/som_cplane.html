<H1> som_cplane </H1>

<H3> Purpose </H3>

<PRE>
 Visualizes a 2D component plane or u-matrix

</PRE>

<H3> Syntax </H3>

<UL><PRE>
  h = som_cplane(topol, color)
  h = som_cplane(lattice, msize, color)
  h = som_cplane(lattice, msize, color)
  h = som_cplane(..., size) 
  h = som_cplane(..., size, pos) 

</PRE></UL>

<H3> Description </H3>

<PRE>
 Creates some basic visualizations of the SOM grid: the component plane and
 the unified distance matrix. The routine draws the SOM grid as a patch
 object according to the specifications given in the input arguments and
 returns its object handle.

 Each unit of the map is presented by a polygon whose color, size, shape
 and location can be specified in various ways. The usual procedure 
 is to choose the lattice and map size used in the map training. Then
 the function creates the standard sheet shaped topological 
 representation of the map grid with hexagonal or rectangular units.
 When the values from a map codebook component (or from SOM_UMAT) 
 are given to the function it produces an indexed coloring for the 
 units (as in SURF command). Another possibility is to give a fixed 
 RGB color for each unit explicitly.

 Special effects (variable unit size, location or shape) can be produced
 giving different types of input variables.

</PRE>

<H3> Known bugs </H3>

<PRE>
 Using 1x3 or 3x1 grids causes problem, as the MATLAB will treat the color 
 information vector 1x3 or 3x1 as a single RGB triple. So, using indexed 
 colors is not possible for this particular map size.

 It is not possible to specify explicit coordinates for map
 consistig of just one unit as then the msize is interpreted as
 map size.

</PRE>

<H3> Required input arguments </H3>

<PRE>
 Note: M is the number of map units

 lattice  The basic shape of the map units 

   (string) 'hexa' or 'rect' creates standard component plane; 
            'hexaU' or 'rectU' creates standard u-matrix.
   (matrix) Lx2 matrix defines the cornes of an arbitary polygon to be used
            as the unit marker. (L is the number of patch vertex: L=6 for 
            'hexa' and L=4 for 'rect') 

 msize    The size of the map grid     

   (vector) [n1 n2] vector defines the map size (height n1 units, width 
            n2 units, total M=n1 x n2 units). The units will be placed to their 
            topological locations to form a uniform hexagonal or rectangular grid.
   (matrix) Mx2 matrix defines arbitrary coordinates for the M units
            In this case the argument 'lattice' defines the unit form only. 

 topol    Topology of the map grid

   (struct) map or topology struct from which the topology is taken

 color    Unit colors

   (string) (ColorSpec) gives the same color for each unit, 'none'
            draws black unit edges only.
   (vector) Mx1 column vector gives indexed color for each unit using the 
            current colormap (see help colormap).   
   (matrix) Mx3 matrix of RGB triples as rows gives each unit a fixed color.

</PRE>

<H3> Optional input arguments </H3>

<PRE>
 Note: M is the number of map units. 
 Note: if unspecified or given empty values ('' or []) default
 values are used for optional input arguments.

 s        The size scaling factors for the units

   (scalar) scalar gives each unit the same size scaling: 
            0   unit disappears (edges can be seen as a dot).
            1   by default unit has its normal size (ie. no scaling)
            >1  unit overlaps others      
   (matrix) Mx1 double: each unit gets individual size scaling

 pos      Position of origin          

   (vector) This argument exists to be able drawing component planes
            in arbitrary locations in a figure. Note the operation:
            if this argument is given, the axis limits setting
            part in the routine is skipped and the limits setting
            will be left to be done by MATLAB's default
            operation. 

</PRE>

<H3> Output arguments </H3>

<PRE>
 h (scalar) handle to the created patch object

</PRE>

<H3> Object tags </H3>

<PRE>
 One object handle is returned: field Tag is set to
  'planeC'  for component plane     
  'planeU'  for U-matrix

</PRE>

<H3> Features </H3>

<PRE>
 There are some extra features in following arguments

 size
  - MxL matrix: radial scaling: the distance between 
    the center of node m and its kth vertex is scaled by
    s(m,k).
  - Mx1x2 matrix: the uniform scaling is done separately for
    x- and y-directions
  - MxLx2 matrix: the scaling is done separately to x- and y-
    directions for each vertex.

 color
    Each vertex may be given individual color. 
    The PATCH object interpolates the colors on the 
    face if shading is turned to interp. 
  - 1xMxL matrix: colormap index for each vertex
  - LxMx3 matrix: RGB color for each vertex

 Note: In both cases (size and color) the ordering of the patch
 vertices in the "built-in" patches is the following

          'rect'      'hexa'
            1 3          1 
            2 4         5 2
                        6 3
                         4

 The color interpolation result seem to depend on the order 
 in which the patch vertices are defined. Anyway, it gives 
 unfavourable results in our case especially with hexa grid: 
 this is a MATLAB feature.

<H3> Examples </H3>

<PRE>
 m=som_make(rand(100,4),'msize',[6 5])         % make a map

 % show the first variable plane using indexed color coding

 som_cplane(m.topol.lattice,m.topol.msize,m.codebook(:,1));  
 or som_cplane(m.topol,m.codebook(:,1));  
 or som_cplane(m,m.codebook(:,1));  

 % show the first variable using different sized black units

 som_cplane(m,'k',m.codebook(:,1));

 % Show the u-matrix. First we have to calculate it. 
 % Note: som_umat returns a matrix therefore we write u(:) to get 
 % a vector which contains the values in the proper order.

 u=som_umat(m); 
 som_cplane('hexaU', m.topol.msize, u(:)); 

 % Show three first variables coded as RGB colors
 % and turn the unit edges off

 h=som_cplane(m, m.codebook(:,1:3),1)
 set(h,'edgecolor','none');

 % Try this! (see section FEATURES)

 som_cplane('rect',[5 5],'none',rand(25,4));
 som_cplane('rect',[5 5],rand(1,25,4));
