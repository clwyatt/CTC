<PRE>
SOM_TRAJECTORY Launch a "comet" trajectory visualization GUI.

  som_show(sM,'umat','all')
  bmus = som_bmus(sM,sD);
  som_trajectory(bmus)
  som_trajectory(bmus, 'data1', sD, 'trajsize', [12 6 3 1]')
  som_trajectory(bmus, 'data1', sD.data(:,[1 2 3]), 'name1', {'fii' 'faa' 'foo'})

 Input arguments ([]'s are optional):
   bmus      (matrix) size Nx1, vector of BMUS
   ['argID', (string) Other arguments can be given as 'argID', value   
    value]   (varies) pairs. See list below for valid values.

 NOTE: the GUI only works on a figure which has been made with SOM_SHOW.

 Here are the valid argument IDs (case insensitive) and associated values: 
  'color'      string 'xor' or ColorSpec, default: 'xor'. 
               (default: according to lattice as in som_cplane)
  'TrajSize'   vector of size Nx1 to define the length of comet
               (N) and size of the comet dots in points. 
               default: [16 12 10 8 6 4]' 
  'Data1'      SOM Toolbox data struct or matrix. The size of
               data matrix (in data struct the field .data) is
               Nxd, where N must be the same as the amount of
               BMUS given in the first input argument 'bmus'
               This data is shown in a new window in d subplots.
               Default: BMU indices (first input argument)
  'Name1'      cell array of d strings which contains names
               for the components in 'Data1'. If 'Data1' is a SOM
               Toolbox data struct, the existing component names 
               are overdone.                 
  'Figure'     scalar that must be a handle to an existing figure
               which has been made using SOM_SHOW function.
               Default: current active figure (gcf).

 The following tools can be found in the 'Tools' -menu.

  Remove Trajectory: removes trajectory from the map.
  Dye Nodes        : opens GUI for selecting color for the nodes
                     and points selected.
  Clear Markers    : removes markers from map and data figure.
  Save             : saves the current situation as a struct.
  Load             : loads the struct from workspace and draws markers.

 Mouse operation

  In data window: Left button is used to drag the operation point ruler  
                  if left button is on blank area, it starts 
  In map window : Left button starts a polygon; right button
                  finishes; middle button toggles a unit.

 SOM_TRAJECTORY is an application for observing trajectory behavior.

 Using mouse the line in data figure can be dragged and the
 trajectory moves in the SOM SHOW figure. It is also possible to move
 trajectory by pressing keys '>' and '<' when mouse pointer is above
 data figure.
 
 Regions can be chosen from the data and the points in that region
 are mapped to the component planes. Regions can be chosen also in
 the map.  In this situation data points and map nodes are also
 marked (Left mouse button adds point to the polygon indicating the
 region and right button finals the polygon). By clicking a node (the
 middle button) that node is either added or removed from selection.
 
 It should be noticed that choosing intervals from data may cause
 situations that seem to be bugs. If there exisist marks of different
 color, removing them by clicking the map may left some marks in the
 data, because more than one point in the data is mapped to the same
 node in the map and the removing operation depends on the color of
 the marks. However, all the marks can be removed by using the 'Clear
 Markers' -operation.

 FEATURES

 The first input argument 'bmus' may also be a munits x N matrix
 In this case each column defines a "fuzzy response". That is,
 each column defines a hit histogram function). The element
 bmus(i,t) sets the size of marker on unit i at time t. 
 NOTE: - in this case no regions can be selcted on the map!
       - only > and < keys can be used to move the operation point
         line: it can't be dragged
       - "fuzzy response is always black (hope this will be fixed) 
       
 It is possible to open a second data window showing different data:
 use indetifiers 'Data2' (and 'Name2'). The argument syntax is
 identical to 'Data1' (and 'Name1').
