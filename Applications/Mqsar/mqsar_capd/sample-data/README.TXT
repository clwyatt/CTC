Attached are the small molecule datasets. trte extensions are used for training and testing part of training where as "valid" extensions are external validation datasets that you should be blinded to. 

I am also attaching a partition file for a4b2 molecules. a4b2_20_1_2.txt file has two columns with binary values. MQSAR generates these partition files for you to randomly pick part of the data to be training data and the remaining to be the test data for modeling step. A value of 1 means the molecule is used in the training phase of the modeling. 

I would normally generate 20 such models; hence the number 20 in the filename. By using this partition files you can generate multiple models each of which have slightly  different training set than the other one. At the end of the modeling, you can use the final models from each partition data to create your ensemble decision system based on these generated models. I didn't get that far to incorporate ensemble modeling into the MQSAR software, but I had written some spagetti matlab code to perform the ensemble modeling task based on the models generated by MQSAR. See the multi-method.zip folder for details. Run the ersin_ensemble_all4.m file to see how it works.
